# Crystal Collector!

### This application is a basic game which asks the user to attempt to math the computer's randomly generated score.

##### The user has the option to click on one of four crystals. Each crystal is assigned a random value between 1 -12 at the start of each game. Clicking a crystal increses the user's score. The user wins if the user's total matches the computer's total; however, if they user goes over the computer's total, they lose.
